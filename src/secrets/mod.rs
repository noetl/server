//! Server-side secret-provider clients (Secrets Wallet Phase 3b,
//! noetl/ai-meta#61).
//!
//! These resolve a secret **reference** to its value from an external secret
//! manager. They live on the server (not the worker) so the keychain/credential
//! resolver can fetch a secret on a cache miss, cache it envelope-encrypted
//! (Phase 1 [`crate::crypto::EnvelopeCipher`]), and hand it back masked — the
//! raw value never enters the workflow data flow. This is the resolution
//! engine; the resolver hook that calls it lands in a later round.
//!
//! [`GcpSecretManager`] is the first backend (next to the existing
//! [`crate::crypto::GcpKms`], which it shares the Workload-Identity token
//! pattern with). AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, and
//! Kubernetes Secrets follow behind the same [`SecretProvider`] trait.
