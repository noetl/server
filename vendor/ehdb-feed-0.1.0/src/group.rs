//! **L1 T1 — consumer groups + ack / ack_wait redelivery + shard routing.**
//!
//! The NATS consumer-group / queue-group equivalent over the T0 change-feed. A
//! [`ShardConsumerGroup`] follows one shard's log and hands each record to
//! **exactly one** group member (competing consumers / load balancing), tracks
//! it **in-flight** until the member **acks** it, and **redelivers** it if the
//! member fails to ack within `ack_wait` (at-least-once delivery — the #166
//! subject-sharding equivalent, one group per shard).
//!
//! **Clock-free.** Like the L0 engine, this carries no wall-clock: `ack_wait`
//! and deadlines are **logical ticks** the caller supplies to
//! [`poll_assign`](ShardConsumerGroup::poll_assign). The networked wiring (a
//! following slice) maps `Instant` → tick; here the coordinator is deterministic
//! and unit-testable. Ordering of the underlying feed and the resume/cursor
//! semantics are inherited from [`crate::ChangeFeed`] / the L0 log, so the group
//! is as durable and replica-fault-tolerant as any other L0 read.
//!
//! **Committed cursor.** [`committed_cursor`](ShardConsumerGroup::committed_cursor)
//! is the contiguous acked-through sort key — every record at or below it is
//! acked and no longer in flight. Persisting it and reconstructing a group from
//! it resumes exactly where the group left off (the durable-progress seam).
