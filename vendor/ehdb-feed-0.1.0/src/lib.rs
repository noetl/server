//! # ehdb-feed — L1 networked change-feed delivery (T0 shadow transport)
//!
//! The networked realisation of topology (c) (per-shard-writer-as-broker): the
//! per-shard writer owns the durable log (an [`L0Engine`]) **and** owns delivery
//! for its shard. This crate is that delivery face — it carries the L0
//! [`ChangeFeed`] (`Watch(shard, cursor)`) batches to subscribers over a real
//! socket, one delivery hop (writer→subscriber) = NATS parity. The control plane
//! (noetl-server) is **not** in this path: it publishes the next record to the
//! writer via [`FeedWriter::append`]; subscribers pull directly from the writer.
//!
//! **T0 posture:** this is the shadow transport — additive, kind/local,
//! comparison-only. NATS stays authoritative; this path only *observes* the same
//! records so their append→subscriber latency can be measured (see
//! `tests/latency.rs`) and compared against NATS before any cutover (T4, gated).
//!
//! Wire protocol (deliberately minimal for the shadow tier): length-prefixed
//! (`u32` big-endian) JSON frames. A subscriber opens a [`TcpStream`], writes one
//! [`SubscribeReq`] frame (`{shard, cursor}`), then reads a stream of batch
//! frames (`Vec<D::Record>`) as the writer appends. `TCP_NODELAY` is set on both
//! ends so a single record is delivered immediately, not Nagle-batched.
//!
//! Delivery is **push, not poll-spin:** the writer signals a [`watch`] channel on
//! each append; each subscriber task drains its feed, then parks on
//! `changed().await` until the next append — an append that races the park
//! advances the watch version, so `changed()` returns immediately (no lost
//! wakeup). Resume/reconnect is exact: reconnect with the last-received
//! `global_sequence` as the cursor (the ack watermark T1 builds on).
