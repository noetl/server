//! **L1 T4 — the networked claim RPC (competing consumers across processes).**
//!
//! The write half (`publish`) and the broadcast delivery (`serve`) don't give
//! *competing* consumption: `serve` fans every record to every subscriber. NATS
//! today gives a pool's N worker replicas one shared durable consumer so each
//! command goes to exactly one worker. This module is that role for the EHDB bus.
//!
//! A [`ClaimCoordinator`] holds **one** [`ShardConsumerGroup`] per shard — the
//! shared coordinator. [`serve_claims`] exposes it over the network; every worker
//! replica opens a [`ClaimClient`] and loops `claim_next → process → ack`. The
//! coordinator hands each command to exactly one caller (competing consumers) and
//! **redelivers** an unacked command after `ack_wait` (member crash → 0 loss),
//! reusing the T1 group's ack/ack_wait semantics — now shared across processes.
//!
//! `claim_next` **blocks** until a command is available (like NATS receive): the
//! coordinator polls the shared group; when the shard is caught up it parks on the
//! writer's tip signal (bounded by a poll interval so `ack_wait` redeliveries
//! surface even with no new appends), then re-competes. Wire protocol mirrors
//! [`crate::publish`]: length-prefixed JSON request in, JSON/ok response out,
//! `TCP_NODELAY`.
//!
//! **Liveness (noetl/ai-meta#208).** A blocking-until-available read is exactly
//! the shape that cannot tell "the writer has nothing for me" from "the writer is
//! gone", so a claim connection needs its own liveness signal or a writer restart
//! wedges every claimer silently. Two independent mechanisms cover it:
//!
//! 1. **TCP keepalive** on both ends ([`crate::configure_stream`]) — a dead peer
//!    becomes an ordinary read error in ~11 s even when no FIN/RST ever arrives,
//!    which is the usual case when a pod is deleted under Kubernetes.
//! 2. **A coordinator heartbeat**, negotiated per connection: a client that asks
//!    for one (`heartbeat_ms` on [`ClaimReq::Next`]) gets one heartbeat frame up
//!    front — proving the peer speaks heartbeats, so the client's read deadline of
//!    [`HEARTBEAT_MISS_FACTOR`] missed beats is armed for the whole connection —
//!    and another whenever a claim has parked that long. This also catches a writer
//!    that is *alive but stuck*, which keepalive cannot: keepalive is answered by
//!    the peer's kernel.
//!
//! Both are backward compatible: heartbeats are only sent to a client that asked,
//! and a client whose peer never heartbeats disarms its deadline and falls back to
//! keepalive-only.
