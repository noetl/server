//! **Every declared build target must resolve to a git-tracked file.**
//!
//! # The failure this exists to catch
//!
//! A manifest can declare a target whose source is not in the repository. The
//! crate then builds perfectly on the machine that wrote it — the file is on
//! disk — and fails on a clean checkout with `file ... does not exist`.
//!
//! It happened here. `.gitignore` carries `**/[Bb]in/*` from the Visual Studio
//! template, which matches Cargo's `src/bin/` convention, so
//! `crates/ehdb-signal-mesh/src/bin/demo.rs` was silently excluded (that
//! crate has since moved to `noetl/signal-mesh` — see
//! `docs/moved/signal-mesh.md` — but the rule it tripped over lived in
//! this repository's `.gitignore`, so the guard stays here):
//!
//! * the crate built locally, because the file was on disk;
//! * `git add <dir>` skipped it **without a word**;
//! * `git status` never showed it, because ignored files are not listed;
//! * `cargo fmt --all --check` on the runner was the first thing in the world
//!   that could notice, and it failed the build.
//!
//! ⚠ **Every local signal was green.** That is the defining property of this
//! failure class and the reason it needs a guard rather than care: there is no
//! amount of attention that makes an ignored file visible in `git status`.
//!
//! # Why this lives in `ehdb-core`
//!
//! The check is about the workspace, not about any one crate, and `ehdb-core`
//! is the crate the workspace is rooted on. A dedicated hygiene crate would be
//! more honest about ownership and less honest about cost.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! Two subprocesses (`cargo metadata --no-deps`, `git ls-files`), no network.
