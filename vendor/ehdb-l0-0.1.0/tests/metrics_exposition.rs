//! **The engine's metrics are scrapable, pinned at zero, and proven to move.**
//!
//! ⚠ WHAT WAS ACTUALLY WRONG. My first audit reported "`metrics.rs` exports 7 functions for
//! an 88-file engine" and filed that as the observability gap. **That count was wrong**: it
//! matched `pub fn` only, while **17 of the 20** incrementers are `pub(crate) fn`, and all
//! **27** metric fields are `pub`. A second pass also reported 4 fields as never written —
//! also wrong, a line-oriented grep missing `self.field\n    .fetch_add(..)`. Checked
//! multi-line-aware: **0 of 27 are unwritten.**
//!
//! The real gap was narrower and had nothing to do with counters missing: **27 good
//! counters that nothing could scrape.** `L0Metrics` was in-process only; the single
//! Prometheus exposition in the workspace lives in `ehdb-feed/src/scaler.rs` and covers
//! consumer lag, not the engine. So prod could not read any of it.
//!
//! This file guards the exposition three ways: the denominator is self-maintaining, every
//! series is pinned at 0, and the ones the lifecycle drives are proven to move.
