// A mutation moving `remember` before the append leaves every test here green.
// The reason is structural rather than an oversight in the tests: the engine

// fails only on a real I/O error, and the usual tricks do not reach it — on Unix
// a write to an already-open descriptor succeeds after the file or directory is

// permissions) runs BEFORE the point the mutation moves.

// anyway, because it would also make the `ingest_append_failed` path from
