//! **D8 — runtime registration** (worker registration / heartbeat / runtime
//! contract, the `noetl.runtime` table), RFC §0.1.
//!
//! Worker lifecycle with **register**, **heartbeat**, **deregister**, and
//! **list-live** — over immutable parts. Modeled as an append-only log of
//! `RuntimeOp`; a worker's current state is its latest op (a fold that, since
//! [`read_index_after`] returns a worker's ops in order, is "the last one"). A
//! monotonic per-worker `heartbeat` rides each op, so liveness is a
//! wall-clock-free predicate: a worker is live if its latest op is not a
//! deregister, and `list_live_since(min)` evicts the stale by heartbeat
//! watermark (the caller advances the watermark on its own tick).
//!
//! Fixed shape: **sort key** = `op_seq`; **partition** + **index dim** =
//! `worker_id` (so a per-worker read touches exactly one worker's history).
//!
