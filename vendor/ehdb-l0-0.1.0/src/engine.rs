//! [`L0EventLogEngine`] — the hot-local / durable-async composite (RFC §2.3) for
//! dataset D1, tying [`crate::part`] (the write engine), [`crate::catalog`] (the
//! meta-catalog), and [`crate::substrate`] (the durability tier) together.
//!
//! ```text
//!   append(exec, txn, payload)
//!     └─ hot: route to shard_for(exec) → PartWriter.append (fsync-per-append, posture A)
//!           └─ on seal trigger → immutable part + manifest row (local-only) + enqueue upload
//!   [background uploader thread]
//!     └─ read sealed part bytes → substrate.put_if_absent → record a replica → rewrite durable manifest
//!   read_execution_after(exec, seq)
//!     └─ manifest.prune(shard, seq)  ← MinMax skip: non-matching parts = zero I/O
//!        └─ per part: sparse_index.locate(seq) → ranged read [mark, end)  ← only the needed block
//!           └─ prefer local_path (hot); else substrate.get_range (durable)
//!        └─ + the active (unsealed) hot buffer
//!   cold_load(substrate)  ← fresh node, empty local dir
//!     └─ read durable manifest → serve reads entirely from the substrate
//!        (reproduces the exact record set + global sequence — the fungible-writer property, RFC §2.7)
//! ```
//!
//! The append path **never** calls the substrate; only the background
//! uploader does. That is the §2.3 claim the L0.1 proof exercises with an
//! injected substrate latency: appends do not regress when uploads are slow.

/// count, snapshot count grows with write count. On prod that reached 6,770
/// snapshots / 19.4 GB behind 71.8 MB of real data, filled the volume, and made
/// every append fail. Retention turns that from quadratic into linear.
///
/// **Two paths, and the sweep is the one that guarantees the bound.** The
/// per-write delete is an O(1) fast path: version `v - retain` is the one that
/// just fell out of the window. It is *best-effort only*. Manifest versions are
/// allocated under the manifest lock, so every integer is produced exactly once,
/// but the substrate writes are issued by two producers — the uploader thread
/// and the merge/drop path — so a version's file can land **after** the delete
/// that was meant to evict it already looked and found nothing. Those stragglers
/// then survive forever. Removing the sweep and keeping only the fast path
/// leaves 6 snapshots instead of 4 after 40 writes at `retain = 4`, and the
/// stragglers are arbitrarily old (`v6` and `v49` among `v77..v80`) — so the
/// fast path alone does not bound anything.
///
/// The periodic sweep is therefore the actual guarantee, and it doubles as the
/// only way to converge a backlog that predates this policy: a sliding window
/// can never reach below its own lower edge, so without the sweep an engine
/// upgraded onto an existing store would keep its 19.4 GB forever. It is
/// throttled to one pass per `retain` writes because
/// [`DurableSubstrate::list_prefix`] walks the whole substrate root, not just
/// the prefix. Every multiple of `retain` is produced exactly once, so the
