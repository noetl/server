//! **The D1 durability window, measured from the append** (noetl/ehdb#328, F4).
//!
//! An acknowledged append is durable on **one** disk immediately (the local part
//! is `fsync`'d before the ack) and reaches the durable substrate only when its
//! part **seals** and the background uploader ships it. The interval between
//! those two points is the durability window: the records that would not come
//! back if the node were lost.
//!
//! ## ⚠ Why the pre-existing metric cannot measure it
//!
//! [`L0Metrics::upload_lag_micros_total`](crate::metrics::L0Metrics) is
//! accumulated as `job.sealed_at.elapsed()` — measured from **seal**. A record
//! waiting in an unsealed active part contributes **nothing** to it. Since
//! sealing is triggered only by size or record count and never by age
//! (noetl/ehdb#329), the pre-seal term is the *dominant* one on a quiet shard —
//! and it is exactly the term that metric is blind to. A dashboard built on it
//! reads healthy in precisely the scenario where events sit unreplicated.
//!
//! This tracker measures from the **append** instead, so the number answers the
//! question an operator is actually asking.
//!
//! ## What it tracks
//!
//! Per shard, the instant of the **oldest** acknowledged record that is not yet
//! durable on the substrate, across two populations:
//!
//! * the **active** (unsealed) part — records acked but not yet even sealed, and
//! * **sealed parts still in flight** to the substrate.
//!
//! The window is `now - min(first_append_at)` over both. When a shard has
//! nothing pending the age is **0**, which is a real reading and not an absence
//! — see [`UnreplicatedTracker::snapshot`].
