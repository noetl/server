//! **The execution-partitioned event chain** — MVP slice of
//! `docs/rfc/ehdb-execution-partitioned-event-store.md` (ai-meta).
//!
//! ## What this is for
//!
//! Today "give me this execution's events" is a **linear filter over every
//! event ever written**: `ehdb-stream` keys records by a global
//! `StreamSequence` and `replay_records` filters the whole `BTreeMap` by
//! subject. So the cost of reading one execution is proportional to everything
//! *other* executions wrote, chain reads time out, a timed-out read is
//! indistinguishable from a short chain, the drive re-drives, and the re-drive
//! adds load to the same store. This module is the storage shape that removes
//! the first link.
//!
//! ## The model (RFC §2)
//!
//! Four ids, and the fourth is what makes this work:
//!
//! ```text
//! event_id, prev_event_id, execution_id, parent_execution_id
//! ```
//!
//! Because a reader is **told** `(execution_id, prev_event_id)`, finding the
//! predecessor is an **address**, not a search. That is the whole trick:
//!
//! | pattern | key | cost |
//! | :-- | :-- | :-- |
//! | **A** predecessor of an event | `(execution_id, prev_event_id)` | **one** index probe |
//! | **B** append | `(execution_id, exec_seq+1)` | partition tail |
//! | **B2** ordered chain read | range `(execution_id, ·)` | `O(k)`, contiguous |
//!
//! ## ⚠ `prev_event_id`, NOT `parent_event_id`
//!
//! The RFC's fork F1, and it is load-bearing. In this codebase
//! `parent_event_id` is a *causal trigger* pointer that is known to **dangle**
//! under the off-server drive (RFC #115 Phase 2 records this explicitly); the
//! walkable chain pointer is `prev_event_id`. Building chain-following on
//! `parent_event_id` would walk into a dangling pointer on exactly the path
//! that is currently failing. This module therefore names its edge
//! `prev_event_id` and treats causal provenance as an unrelated attribute.
//!
//! ## Status: INERT
//!
//! Nothing calls this. It is not wired into the tier, the engine, the drive or
//! any write path. It is the primitive, with its proofs, so the wiring can be a
//! separate reviewable step.
