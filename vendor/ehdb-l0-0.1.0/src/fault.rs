//! A deterministic fault-injection seam for the write path.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Two real properties of this crate were **untestable**, and both are on the
//! path that matters most:
//!
//! 1. **`append_record` remembers a dedupe key only AFTER the write succeeds**
//!    (noetl/ai-meta#313). Remembering first would let a failed append poison its
//!    key, so the retry the failure exists to invite would be answered "already
//!    present" for a record that is not there — silent loss. A mutation moving
//!    `remember` earlier left every test green, because nothing could make an
//!    append fail.
//! 2. **`ingest_append_failed` / the ingest failure path** (ehdb#345). That
//!    counter exists because a full volume and a serde-incompatible record
//!    produced byte-identical symptoms and no signal at all — a production writer
//!    sat `Ready`, 0 restarts, 0 ERROR lines while every command publish failed.
//!    Reaching it in a test previously required actually filling a disk.
//!
//! The usual tricks do not work here: on Unix a write to an already-open
//! descriptor survives `chmod` and `unlink`, and the one step that *can* fail on
//! permissions (`ensure_writer`) runs before the point under test.
//!
//! # Why it is always compiled rather than feature-gated
//!
//! A `required-features` test target is skipped by a plain `cargo test
//! --workspace`, which is what CI runs — so the tests would exist and never
//! execute. That is the same defect class this seam was built to close, one level
//! up, so it is not an acceptable trade.
//!
//! The cost is **one relaxed atomic load per append**, against a ~4 ms `fsync`.
//! That is not a measurable trade; guaranteed coverage is.
//!
//! # Why it is inert
//!
//! The counter starts at 0 and only [`fail_next_appends`] raises it. Nothing in
//! any binary calls that — it is reachable from tests alone — so a production
//! process can never arm it. Same argument as `Dataset::dedupe_key` returning
//! `None`: inert by construction, not by configuration.

    // `fetch_update` is deprecated from rustc 1.99.0, which renamed it to
    // `try_update`. We keep the old name deliberately: this workspace declares
    // `rust-version = "1.82"`, and `try_update` does not exist before 1.99 — so
    // adopting the new name would raise the MSRV by 17 releases to silence a pure
    // rename with identical semantics and no behaviour change.
    //
    // ⚠ This allow is why `main` is not red. The clippy step here gates with
    // `-D warnings` and no allow-list, and CI installs `@stable`, which rolled to
    // 1.99.0 on 2026-10-03 — so the next run would have failed on a deprecation
    // that no commit introduced. Found by noetl/ai-meta#378 while pinning the
    // toolchain, not by the build.
    //
    // Scoped to this expression rather than the crate, so a different deprecated
    // call still fails the gate. Remove it when the MSRV moves past 1.99 and
    // switch to `try_update`.
