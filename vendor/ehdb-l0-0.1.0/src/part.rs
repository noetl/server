//! The VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs-style **write engine** for one partition:
//! an in-memory buffer + an active local part → sealed **immutable part** (RFC
//! §2.1, §2.3).
//!
//! - Appends land in an active local part file (the hot tier), framed with the
//!   #254 codec ([`crate::frame`]).
//! - Under **posture A** ([`FlushPolicy::EveryAppend`], the D1 default) each
//!   append `fsync`s before returning — the local part is durable before ack,
//!   reusing #254's fsync-per-append strength.
//! - Under **posture B** ([`FlushPolicy::Buffered`]) appends batch and `fsync` on
//!   a threshold (and always on seal) — VM's larger-crash-window / higher-
//!   throughput posture, for derived tiers only (RFC §2.3 / §6.1).
//! - On the seal trigger (size or record count) the active part becomes an
//!   immutable `.eslog` file and a [`SealedPart`] carrying its [`PartMeta`]
//!   (partition, min/max sort key, sparse index) — ready for the manifest + the
//!   async upload.
//!
//! The active (unsealed) part's records are also held in memory so a read sees
//! the hot buffer regardless of flush posture — read-your-writes for the tail.
