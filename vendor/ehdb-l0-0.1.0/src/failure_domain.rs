//! **Failure domains for durable substrates** (noetl/ehdb#332, F5).
//!
//! ## The gap this closes
//!
//! [`LocalFsSubstrate`](crate::substrate::LocalFsSubstrate) is the only
//! *storage-backing* `DurableSubstrate` in the tree —
//! [`CountingSubstrate`](crate::substrate::CountingSubstrate) is a transparent
//! decorator over another, not an independent store. So "the durable substrate"
//! is a filesystem path, and whether that path is a *distinct failure domain* is
//! decided entirely by what is mounted there. **Nothing checked.**
//!
//! In production nothing was:
//!
//! ```text
//! NOETL_EVENT_BUS_WRITER_DIR   = /data/eventbus
//! NOETL_EHDB_TIER_SERVICE_DIR  = /data/eventbus/ehdb-tier
//! ```
//!
//! `/data/eventbus` is one PVC. The substrate copy lives in a **subdirectory of
//! the same volume as the part it is a copy of**, so replication buys no
//! independent failure domain: the upload turns an unsealed local part into a
//! sealed local part beside it.
//!
//! ⚠ This is not a claim that loss is likely — GCE persistent disks are
//! replicated within a zone by the platform. It is a claim that **the durability
//! story the code tells and the one the deployment implements are different**,
//! and only the deployment is load-bearing.
//!
//! ## What this module adds
//!
//! A substrate now *declares* its failure domain, and
//! [`validate_replica_domains`] refuses a replica set whose members share one.
//! An RF of N over one domain is an RF of 1 wearing a larger number.
