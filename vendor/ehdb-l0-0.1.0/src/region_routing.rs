//! **Read-locality routing / follower reads** (multi-region spec M6).
//!
//! ## ⛔ SCAFFOLD — gated behind M5, not activated
//!
//! Flag defined, types conforming to the spec, **no routing performed**.
//! [`resolve_route`] refuses [`ReadLocality::Nearest`] rather than quietly
//! serving from the owner, because a scaffold that silently does today's
//! thing is indistinguishable from a working feature that happens to pick the
//! owner every time — and that is the failure M6's own exit criterion E4 is
//! written against ("a run where `candidates=0` on every read is a FAILED
//! exit, not a passing one").
//!
//! ⚠ **Why M5 gates this.** Serving a read from a non-owner replica is only
//! sound while exactly one writer owns the shard. Until fencing is enforcing
//! (M5), single-writer rests on `replicas: 1` — an orchestration preference,
//! not a mutual-exclusion primitive. A follower read under two writers can
//! return a prefix of a log that another node is concurrently diverging from.
//!
//! The freshness half already exists and is real: see
//! [`crate::closed_timestamp`] (M3). This module is only the *selection*.
