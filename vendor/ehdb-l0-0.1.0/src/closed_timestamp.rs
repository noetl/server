//! **Closed timestamps and read freshness** (multi-region spec M3).
//!
//! Read-side only. Nothing here is on the append path and nothing here is
//! wired into a serving path yet — this is the predicate a read routes on.
//!
//! ## What a closed timestamp is
//!
//! The point up to which a replica's contents are known complete: no record
//! with a position at or below it can still arrive. A read asking for data "as
//! of T" is safe on this replica exactly when `T <= closed`.
//!
//! ## Where the number comes from
//!
//! [`UnreplicatedTracker`](crate::unreplicated::UnreplicatedTracker) already
//! computes the input: per shard, the age of the **oldest acknowledged record
//! not yet durable on the substrate**, measured from the *append*.
//!
//! ⚠ Deliberately **not** `L0Metrics::upload_lag_micros_total`. That is
//! accumulated as `job.sealed_at.elapsed()` — measured from **seal** — so a
//! record sitting in an unsealed active part contributes nothing to it. On a
//! quiet shard the pre-seal term dominates, which is precisely the case a
//! seal-based number is blind to. `unreplicated.rs` says it in its own words:
//! *"A dashboard built on it reads healthy in precisely the scenario where
//! events sit unreplicated."* A closed timestamp built on that metric would
//! claim freshness exactly when it is most wrong.
//!
//! ## ⚠ `as_of` is not decoration
//!
//! Every [`ClosedTimestamp`] carries when it was computed. A number with no
//! staleness signal is not evidence — `noetl.execution.status` read exactly
//! like live data for months after its writer was retired. A consumer that
//! cannot tell a fresh closed timestamp from a stale one has learned nothing.
//!
//! ## Units
//!
//! Positions are **milliseconds since the Unix epoch**, matching the
//! `UnreplicatedTracker` age input. When the HLC lands (M2, `ehdb-core`), a
//! closed timestamp becomes `Hlc::physical_millis()` and this module's
//! arithmetic is unchanged — the conversion is one call at the boundary.
