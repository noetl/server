//! Secret-free L0 instrumentation (RFC §5 exit criterion: "secret-free
//! metrics"). Plain atomic counters — no payloads, no execution ids, no keys.
//!
//! The append counters show the hot path; the upload counters show the
//! durable-async tier and its lag (seal → object-store durable); the read
//! counters show pruning effectiveness. A monitoring layer (a later slice) maps
//! these onto Prometheus gauges; here they are the observable surface the L0.1
//! proofs assert against.
