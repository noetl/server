//! Dataset definitions for L0 — the FIXED, compiled-in schemas (RFC §0.1).
//!
//! L0.1 implements **D1, the event log**. Each dataset has a fixed schema, a
//! fixed sort key, and a fixed partition function — the properties that let L0
//! be purpose-built (no runtime DDL, no discovered schema). Adding a dataset is
//! a deliberate compiled-in change here, never a runtime operation.
